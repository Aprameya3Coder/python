# Neha's Math: Neha is practising basic math in Python. Help her write a Python program
# that calculates the result of the following expression: (25 + 30) * 3 / 2.

nehas_number_right = float((25+30)*3/2)

xd = int(34.9) # x stores 34 and ignores the fraction .9 if there is given int. To overcome this problem use float
print(xd)
